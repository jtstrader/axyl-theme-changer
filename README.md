# Axyl Theme Changer (AXTC)
In using Linux distributions, I've found it sometimes a large pain in the rear end to change my color scheme around. I'm a big fan of keeping things fresh, and sometimes I really like to go from something cool and chill like Monokai to something completely different like Solarized Light. Because of that, and because I'm tired of changing everything from their inidividual files, I've written a program in Rust to handle this for me.

Note that this probably not work on your system since it's specifically tailored to work on mine. This repo is public solely to show my progress in learning Rust, as that is my language of focus currently.
